## How It Works
**Please allow up to 30 seconds to initially load in movies**

- On load, the app fetches **popular movies** from the TMDB API.
- Users can search using **genre** and optional **keywords**.
- Movie cards show title, poster, and a brief description.
- Clicking ‚ûï adds a movie to your Watch Later list (unless already saved).
- The **Watch Later** page shows all saved movies and lets users remove them.
- Changes are stored in a local SQLite database on the Flask backend.
